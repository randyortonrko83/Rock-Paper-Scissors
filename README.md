# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 A simple JavaScript code for testing rock-paper-scissors on console log

(i) Created Pseudocode for Rock-Paper-Scissors program for ease of creating the program
(ii) Planning the code by breaking the problem into pieces and testing by deploying function called computerPlay() to bring a random output between "rock" "paper" or "Scissor".
(iii) completed the function computerPlay (the computer brings "rock", "paper" or "scissors" randomly whenever computerPlay() function is called) 
(iv) in process of playRound function where the user inputs rocks, paper or scissor against randomly generated AI opponent computer 
(v) generated a function called playRound which calls computerPlay function(calls random rock, paper, scissors)
(vi) generated a code for making the input of user to convert the string to make the first word capitalized for eg: Rock, Paper, Scissor, irrespective of the input the user types.
(vii) implemented if conditional statement for || (OR) operator to decide the result, the result is unsatisfactory, searching for potential errors
(viii) after a thorough research, seems that the OR operator becomes true when even one of the value is false (for eg: if player entered rock and computer paper then the code ignore the false computer code and execute the wrong code block) so to make things right I tried to employ && (AND) operator and things went smooth, the result is satisfactory, there can be more code optimizations done but that will be for later stage.
(ix) after a successful code achieved objective for storing the scores for the rock paper scissor game, the key is that let variable declares within function scope(this means that let variable is not visible outside function) i was making a mistake of initializing let variable to 0 everytime a loop is called so the score was not added up, the problem was solved by var variable which declares on a global scope outside as well as inside function(this means that this function is visible inside as well as outside the function) so when i initialized the loop, I initialized the var variable on global scope an conducted loop so that the score is adding up, the result was successful.
(x) created a fourth function that judges the ultimate result of the game function, attempted to create within game function but the judging part executed each time a user inputs a string so created a separate function. Now the full game is functional, further optimization of code will be done as necessary.
