Rock-Paper Scissors PseudoCode

Objective: To create computerPlay function that returned randomly by the computer

1. create function to achieve this
2. use Math.random(mind case-sensitive)to deploy number between 0 to 1(1 does not gets printed)
3. find a way to print a number that randomises between 1, 2 and 3
4. using if conditionals take 1, 2 and 3 to judge the output string to randomize the string.
5. for the purpose of dividing the randomness of the return string five empty string is inserted at array

Result: Success

Objective: To create playRound function that plays a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1. function with two parameters called playerSelection and computerSelection is created
2. computerSelection is generated randomly from computerPlay
3. playerSelection is generated from user
4. the result is validated in the function inside
5. winner is announced via alert

  Branched Pseudocode
  Objective: To create a code that takes the user input validates that input and gives the output

   1. the input must be converted to upper and lowercase to avoid any case sensitivity issues
   2. inside the function the validation between randomly generated rock, paper, scissor and user input must take place.
          (i) recieve the user input
          (ii) recieve the computer input
          (iii) store the user input in a variable for case conversion
          (iv) store the computer input in a variable
          (v) use if conditionals to compare the user input to the OR operater (test OR operater) and return the original string to compare with the randomly generated computer one.
          (vi) use if conditionals again to compare the result of the operator(user) with the computer to tell the ultimate end result.
   3. after the validation is complete a result string is returned in the form of alert or return command.



Objective: to compare the user input and randomly generated computer input to determine a winner and print the result

1. store user input in a variable, store computer input in a variable.

2. logic workflow: rock > scissor
                   scissor > paper
                   paper > rock

3. equality operator === for three other possibilities: rock === rock
                                                        paper === paper
                                                        scissor === scissor

Objective: to create a new function that can call the playRound function to let the user play the game of rock paper scissor five rounds with the computer

1. create new function called game
2. call playRound inside this function
3. assign a variable for playRound in this function 
4. create a for loop for 5 rounds
5. compare the 5 rounds to determine the ultimate winner of the rock-paper-scissors.
